## Chair Shop Web
This website is about chair shop, and I implement layout grid and flexbox. The steps that I'm using are:
- initial global margin, padding, and box-sizing
- create html with semaintic html
- create dummy content
- adding images
- adding white space for every content
- adding border radius
- adding icons
- adding box-shadow
